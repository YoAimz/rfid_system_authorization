   const char* password = "Your_WiFi_Password";  // Replace with your WiFi password

   // MQTT and API settings
   const char* mqttServer = "YOUR_IP";          // Replace with your MQTT broker IP (local network)
   const int mqttPort = 8883;                   // Default MQTT TLS port - do not change
   const char* mqtt_topic = "rfid/readings";     // Default MQTT topic - do not change
